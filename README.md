# Cancer diagnosis prediction using multiple machine learning techniques
# Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018.  Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer worldwide, contributing about one ninth of the total number of new cases diagnosed in 2018. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, Although the number of deaths associated with breast cancer is steadily declining largely because of earlier detection, breast cancer survival rates have increased.  
# Recently, machine learning (ML) approaches have been applied in cancer prediction. With the help of ML, we can better understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant so as to help early diagnosis and reduce unnecessary surgical excision. However, different ML platforms and prediction methods may lead to varied performance outcome. In this study, in order to get better accuracy of prediction performance, we utilize multiple ML prediction models provided by Python and its machine learning library (scikit-learn), Apache Spark and its machine learning library (MLlib), Microsoft SQL server 2012 and its mining package to compare those approaches toward a better diagnostic prediction of breast cancer. In addition, how feature selection could contribute to the prediction accuracy is also explored in this study.
